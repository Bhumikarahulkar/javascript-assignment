Q4. Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why
not?
function foo1()
{
return {
bar: "hello"
};
}
function foo2()
{
return
{
bar: "hello"
};
}



Ans: in javascript ; means nothing ; is unnecessay part of javascript. in javascript global contex is created because of that first funcation return a value and 2nd is undifine.
