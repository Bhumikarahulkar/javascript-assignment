Q3. What will be the output of the following code?
var Employee =
{
company: 'Rohit'
}
var Emp1 = Object.create(employee);
delete Emp1.company Console.log(emp1.company);
 
Ans: output of this code is error because javascript is case sensitive when we pass this object that is not call any onject.
